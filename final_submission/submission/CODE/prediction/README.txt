*** Overview ***
This README outlines the code and data included in the "CODE/prediction" folder.

Code:

- Prediction notebook (Prediction.ipynb)

Data:

- Prediction input, generated by the data harmonizer script in "CODE/acquisition" (input/prediction_input.tab)

The Jupyter notebook documents exploration and comparison of linear regression and random forest models, as well as the code required to train, test, predict, and write prediction outputs.


*** Prerequisites ***
The following prerequisites must be met to run this application:

* Python 3.7
* A web browser

Required Python libraries:
* jupyter
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn (sklearn)
* statsmodels


*** Running the notebook ***
1. Launch a Jupyter session. If you have Anaconda installed, run `jupyter notebook` from a command line/terminal session. If not, you may need to run it using `python -m jupyter notebook`.
2. Jupyter will launch in your browser. Navigate to the folder containing this README.txt. Click on "Prediction.ipynb".
3. In the Table of Contents, click "Fitting the Model - Linear Regression - Full Model".
4. Select the variable you wish to predict. In the cell directly beneath the section header, set a value for the `response_var` variable - either "death_rate" or "deaths_age_adj".
5. At the top, click "Kernel > Restart & Run All". Wait for the entire notebook to run; it will write out two CSVs. The exponential smoothing/feature projection section may take a while to complete.
